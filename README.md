### Responsive Layout

It follows a responsive layout using Media Queries where the width is 600px for desktop and break-point is 480px for mobile view.

### Accessibility

I followed WCAG's AA guideline for accessibility:

- Used **aria** attributes such as **role**, **alt** when needed.
- Ensured proper tabbing focus styling for keyboard use.
- Ensured the screen readers are working properly.

**Note**
Following colour contrasts failed the WCAG AA test (tested on https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/). 1. Foreground Color - #ffffff Background Color - #4fc1e9 2. Foreground Color - #ffffff Background Color - #ffce54 3. Foreground Color - #ffffff Background Color - #8cc152
I used these colour contrast for this test, in real time situtaion I will work with design team to make sure colours used in design mockup passes WCAG AA test.
